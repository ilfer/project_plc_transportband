## About
The idea was to test this DC motor on the conveyor belt. More specifically, whether the motor was strong enough to run the conveyor belt.

## Materials and methods

- DC Motor: Getriebemotor IG320516-FWF22R, 24V, 1:516
- PLC card for the DC Motor: EL7332

## Result
The dc motor is not strong enough to run the conveyor belt.

## Solution
Use a different (stronger) motor. The stepper motor AS1010-0000 will be tested.
